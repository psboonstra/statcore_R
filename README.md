# UMich Global Stat Core Workshop 

Contains resources for the 'Expanding Your Biostatistics Toolkit for Biomedical and Public Health Research' workshop offered by the School of Public Health Global Stat Core

I have implemented many of the ideas and pedagogies that Garrett Grolemund and the other professional educators at RStudio teach in their workshops, including

- Master the tidyverse: https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse

- Train-the-Trainer: Tidyverse Track: https://github.com/rstudio-education/teach-tidy


All exercises are my own except where noted.
