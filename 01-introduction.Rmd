This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this "chunk" by clicking the *Run* button (the green triangle in the upper right of chunk) or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (*Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows) at the same time. The result should appear immediately below the chunk. 

```{r}
3+3;
```

Click the *Knit* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* (*Ctrl+Shift+K*) to create the HTML file. You can re-knit as often as you like. Now, add a new chunk below. To do so, put your cursor where you want it to go and click *Code* > *Insert Chunk* from the toolbar or  press *Cmd+Option+I* (*Ctrl+Alt+I*). Type in your favorite arithmetic operation and try running the chunk. 


## Exercises

Run the following chunks. Based on the input and the output, hypothesize what the code does, and type it above each chunk.


1.
```{r}
sample(1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE);
```


2. 
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2");
library(ggplot2);
```

3. 
```{r}
