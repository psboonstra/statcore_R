This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this code "chunk" by clicking the *Run* button (the green triangle in the upper right of chunk) or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (*Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows) at the same time. The output should appear immediately below the chunk. 

```{r}
3+3;
```

Now, add a new chunk below. To do so, put your cursor where you want it to go and click *Code* > *Insert Chunk* from the toolbar or  press *Cmd+Option+I* (*Ctrl+Alt+I*). Type in your favorite arithmetic operation and try running the chunk. 

## Exercises

Run the following chunks. Based on the input and the output: hypothesize what the code is doing, and type your answer below, replacing the `<XXX>`. 

```{r}
sample(x = 1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE);
```
1. <XXX>

Compare the output from the code chunk immediately that appears on your computer to that of a neighbor. Is it identical?

2. <XXX>

```{r}
set.seed(1);
sample(x = 1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE);
```

Compare again your output to a neighbor's. Is it identical?

3. <XXX>

```{r}
x <- c(1, 0.02, 10.3, 8);
x; 
sort(x);
```

4. <XXX>

```{r}
mean(x);
log(x);
```

5. <XXX>

```{r, eval = F}
library(survival);
```
6. <XXX>

```{r}
getwd();
```

7. <XXX>

## Bonus question 

Can you use what you've see so far to create a new `R` chunk below that calculates the average of the logarithm of `x`?

## Putting it all together

If you want to create a final, finished product of your work to share with your partner, children, parents, or labmates, click the *Knit* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* (*Ctrl+Shift+K*) to create a PDF of your entire notebook. If you want to create an HTML or Word file instead, click the down arrow next to *Knit* and choose another option; future knits will also knit to this new format until you change it again.  

Another helpful tip: put your cursor anywhere in this document and press *Cmd+Option+P* (*Ctrl+Alt+P* in Windows) to run all chunks above the cursor in your console. 

You've finished your first notebook!
