This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing the code "chunk" below, which adds the number 3 to itself, by clicking the *Run* button (the green triangle in the upper right of chunk) or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (*Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows) at the same time. The output should appear immediately below the chunk. 

```{r}
3+3;
```

Now, add a new chunk below. To do so, put your cursor where you want it to go and click *Code* > *Insert Chunk* from the toolbar or  press *Cmd+Option+I* (*Ctrl+Alt+I*). Type in your favorite arithmetic operation and try running the chunk. 

## Exercises

Run the following chunks. Follow the instructions after each numbered item, replacing the `<XXX>` with your response / answer. 

```{r}
dice_rolls <- sample(x = 1:6, size = 30, replace = TRUE);
dice_rolls;
```

1. Hypothesize what the code in the chunk above did.

<XXX>

2. Compare the output from the code chunk immediately that appears on your computer to that of a neighbor. Is it identical?

<XXX>

```{r}
dice_rolls == 3;
```

3. Hypothesize what the code in the chunk above did.

<XXX>

```{r}
library(survival);
```

4. Hypothesize what the code in the chunk above did.

<XXX>

Assuming you successfully ran the previous code chunk, you now have access to a pre-loaded dataset called `pbc`. A description of the data (which we'll discuss later) is as follows:

"This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine." 

For now, let's focus on the albumin measurements taken at baseline. The first line of code below takes the first 20 observations' serum albumin measurement and stores it in a vector called `x`.

```{r}
x <- pbc$albumin[1:20];
sort(x);
```

5. Hypothesize what the second line of code in the chunk above did.

<XXX>

```{r}
mean(x);
log(x);
```

6. You should have seen that `mean(x)` outputs a single number, whereas `log(x)` outputs a set of numbers. Keeping this in mind, hypothesize what the code in the chunk above did and try to explain this difference in outputs. 

<XXX>

7. See if you can create a new `R` chunk below that calculates the average of the logarithm of `x`.

<XXX>


## Putting it all together

If you want to create a final, finished product of your work to share with your partner, children, parents, grocer, or labmates, click the *Knit* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* (*Ctrl+Shift+K*) to create a PDF of your entire notebook. If you want to create an HTML or Word file instead, click the down arrow next to *Knit* and choose another option; future knits will also knit to this new format until you change it again.  

Another helpful tip: put your cursor anywhere in this document and press *Cmd+Option+P* (*Ctrl+Alt+P* in Windows) to run all chunks above the cursor in your console. 

You've finished your first notebook!
